## Welcome to Bamazon! 

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. Within the Bamazon customer.js , you can view the inventory then choose an item you'd like to purchase along with the quantity you want, and voila! Transaction complete! However, if we do not have enough 
of the selected item in stock deeming us unable to fulfill your purchase, the transaction will not go through.

Within the bamazon manager.js, you can view all inventory in the store, view all low inventory (less than 5 items in stock), update the inventory back to the stock quantity, and even add new items to your inventory! 

Happy shopping!

## Built With
`MySQL`
`Node.JS`
`JavaScript`
